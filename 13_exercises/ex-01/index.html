      <h1>Understanding Lorem Ipsum: The Classic Placeholder Text</h1>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard for placeholder text since
        the 1960s. It is used by designers, developers, and publishers to fill a
        space on a page with text that resembles natural language, allowing them
        to focus on design rather than content.

      <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum</h2>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is a scrambled version of a passage from “De finibus bonorum
        et malorum,” a work by the Roman statesman Cicero, written in 45 BC. The
        standard Lorem Ipsum passage has been used since the 1500s when an
        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book.
