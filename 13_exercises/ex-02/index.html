      In a rapidly changing world, the power of imagination is crucial for
      innovation. Albert Einstein once said,
      <span style="color: #ff5555; font-style: italic"
        >Imagination is more important than knowledge</span
      >, emphasizing that while knowledge is valuable, itâ€™s our ability to dream
      and envision new possibilities that drives progress.
