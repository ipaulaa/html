      <dt>Black Hole</dt>
      <dd>
        A region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that
        nothing, not even light, can escape it.
      </dd>
      <dt>Supernova</dt>
      <dd>
        A massive explosion that occurs when a star exhausts its fuel and
        collapses under its own gravity, often leading to the creation of a
        neutron star or black hole.
      </dd>
      <dt>Nebula</dt>
      <dd>
        A large cloud of gas and dust in space, often a region where new stars

      </dd>
      <dt>Planet</dt>
      <dd>
        A celestial body that orbits a star, has sufficient mass to assume a
        nearly round shape, and has cleared its orbit of other debris.
      </dd>
      <dt>Dwarf Planet</dt>
      <dd>
        A celestial body that also orbits a star and has sufficient mass to be
        nearly round, but it has not cleared its orbital path of other debris.
      </dd>
      <dt>Exoplanet</dt>
      <dd>A planet that orbits a star outside our solar system.</dd>
